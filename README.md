# news-API-PHP-request
This is my code for pulling from the newsapi.org API via PHP in a simple way!


For this, I have created a simple foreach set to show the base information for the article but it can be expanded out to include other items that can be returned on the API.

The request is in the request.php file. It should be as simple as adding this code to your page and the request will be returned with a Header, image, summery and Link to the original new sources page.

Screenshot of this can be seen in the Screenshot file.

To See a working example of this system in action i have set up a demo page on https://projects.jonoclark.xyz/
